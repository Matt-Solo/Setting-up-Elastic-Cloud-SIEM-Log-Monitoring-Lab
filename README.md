# Setting-up-Elastic-Cloud-SIEM-Log-Monitoring-Lab

This project demonstrates how to set up a basic Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment using Elastic Cloud (ELK Stack) for centralized log ingestion, monitoring, alerting, and threat detection.

 
First you go to {https://www.elastic.co/cloud} to creat an account or login if you already have an account

Next, you choose what you want to do with your Elastic account (I chose for training or academic purpose)

Choose your prefered use case (in my case, it's Elastic for security...details in the image below)

Next, you choose how you intend to use Elastic for Security (I am going to use mine for SIEM & Security Analytics)

Since it's web based, you'll have to pick a webbased destination to store your data. Once that is done, you go ahead and launch your account

It takes a few minutes to set up you account to be ready for use
